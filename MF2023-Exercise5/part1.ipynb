    "There are two major advantages to representing rigid transformations with dual quaternions for blending:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: Dual quaternions provide a linear representation of rigid transformations, which makes it easier to blend multiple transformations together in a smooth and continuous way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency: Dual quaternions provide a consistent way to represent both rotations and translations as a single entity, which avoids issues with interpolation between separate rotation and translation representations."
